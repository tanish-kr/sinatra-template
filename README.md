# Sinatra Template

## Install

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:tatsu07/sinatra-template.git
$ bundle
```

## Use Case
Why isn't Rails, but Sinatra used?
- When a data base exists in existence.
- When it's developed on a small scale.
-  When I'd like to build a project only of API by the smallest composition.
